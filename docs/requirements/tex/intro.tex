        There are 3 main groups of users for \projectName:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \emph{Music schools}. Music schools manage the instructors and students under their umbrella of operation. They have permissions to add/remove association with the other user types, as well as special operations regarding interactions between the user groups.
            \item \emph{Music instructors}. Instructors interact with their associated companies and students. The students can be private or managed by a music school. Instructors are primarily responsible for lesson plans and practice resources for their students, and sharing such resources with schools or other teachers.
            \item \emph{Music students}. Students have access to a history of their lesson plans, practice resources, and communication with their associated instructor or school.
