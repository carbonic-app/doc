\section{Introduction}
    Our project is a \todo. This section will describe this document and provide the glossary/references.
    \subsection{Document Purpose}
        % \emph{Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, including the revision or release number. Describe the scope of the product that is covered by this SRS, particularly if this SRS describes only part of the system or a single subsystem.\gnl Write 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of this document as explained above.}
        This \gls{srs} document aims to specify overall requirements for \projectName. It will contain information about the entire public-facing \projectName\ project regarding non-functional requirements, functional requirements with their use-case diagrams, references to cited outside sources, definitions for uncommon terms, and the process of creating this document. There will be separate documentation about the \gls{devops} of the project, as that is outside the scope of this \gls{srs}.
    \subsection{Product Scope}
        \emph{Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals.\gnl 1-2 paragraphs describing the scope of the product. Make sure to describe the benefits associated with the product.}
    \subsection{Intended Audience and Document Overview}
        \emph{Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended for, such as developers, project managers, marketing staff, users, testers, and documentation writers (In your case it would probably be the `client' and the professor). Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how it is organized. Suggest a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the overview sections and proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to each reader type.}
