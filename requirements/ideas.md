# Project Ideas
Should include some aspects of messaging, make use of Go's concurrency as a backend, and be scalable with Kubernetes.

## Machine learning chat thing
* Users upload chat logs, TensorFlow.js trains on those and responds to incoming messages. Could automate messaging with FaceBook, WhatsApp, whatever Android/iPhone texting apps...
    * Could also include some sentiment analysis?
    * Text prediction, such as in Google's Allo or Email responses
## Music teacher thing
* Could be generalized to other fields
* Examples of users: Companies, Teachers, Students
    * Companies can manage their teachers' stuff, assign subs, etc.
    * Teachers can manage their students' lesson sheets, both under the umbrella of a company or private, and share practice/lesson resources with other teachers/company/students.
    * Students can see previous lesson sheets and practice resources
* Relational database
* Single Sign-On (integration with Google sign in?)
* Document storage in Google Drive? In our own databases? How should editing of lesson sheets work? 
* Option to download all accessible documents, lesson sheets, resources
* Allow uploading photos/screenshots/scans/documents into lesson sheets or as dedicated lesson resources
