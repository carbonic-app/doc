    We estimated that each team member spent about 60 hours individually over the course of all milestones. The first milestone took several hours to set up LaTeX and simplify later documentation, and many more hours of discussion and writing to finalize the SRS document. The second document benefited from the LaTeX work, but required more time for design, planning, and writing of documentation. The third milestone contained the most headaches due to lack of documentation and examples, not to mention learning several new technologies.
