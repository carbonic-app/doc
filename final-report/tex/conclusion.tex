    We conclude that it is better to under-promise and over-deliver than to over-promise and under-deliver. We underestimated how much time would be spent dealing with compatibility issues between libraries and frameworks, as well as the devops that inspired us to use the tech stack that we did. Going back, we would limit the project scope to what we are most interested in and focus on making that a better product.
