\section{Group Log}\label{sec:group-log}
    Group members met in person about once or twice every month to specifically work on project design. Group members then worked largely independently but would reach out for collaboration when needed. When approaching deadlines, collaboration increased to ensure everyone is on the same page and to speed up productive development. Communication was effective as both chat and voice communication was used online when available.
